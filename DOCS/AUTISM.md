## Data

Autism data, takes in a 4D brain scan and extracts and combines both signal information and time series information to calculate sparse inverse covariance this represents the connections in the brain. In theory this should be a good metric to determine ASD in brains.

## Model

This uses either a support vector machine or a xgboost decision tree in order to determine boundries.
