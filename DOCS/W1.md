## Week 1

### Objective

We want to try and begin processing data
Deeper dive into model selection, run down and more literature review on the models that we have looked at for the professor

### Questions

? - Statistical model, have questions: what is the goal / scope that is in mind by the professor and us seems that we have different ideas about what the project actuall means.
? - Why take output from a bunch of NNs and combine when we could just use a niave statistical model?
? - What's the point of training all these models if we're bais towards certian models why not just use the model we're bias towards?
? - Start with the goal in mind wwe shouldn't just mindlessly process data or select models if we don't know what we're doing we need to have an idea of what we're doing or else we may have to go back and re-select models and re-process data.

### What have we Done?

Went over the process of training a model.
Visualized a section of our data.

### Things to Keep in Mind

If we know we want to use a CNN that takes an input nxm or n then how should we process our data in this case?
General case processing. "think about how we processed and visualized the cross section how do we go about this in the gen case?"
