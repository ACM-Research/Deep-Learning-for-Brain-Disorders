**ACM Research, Fall 2021**

## Abstract

Pain and suffering you should check out the docs [here](DOCS)

## Background

- Our research attempts to propose a vector for future research
in creating more generalized models for brain disorder diagnosis

## Data

- 2D Brain Data
- 3D Brain Data
- 4D Brain Data
- Sources of each of these datasets
- Nuero data hard to get

## Models

- Various CNNs
- XGBOOST
- AugmentedOr

## Results

There were results!
- 94% ALZ - ACTUAL (86%)
- 93% BRN - ACTUAL (92%)
- 92% SCH - ACTUAL (???)
- >70% COMBINED (UH OH)

## Conclusions

Original Models were overfit. New Models didn't have much time to be trained
better generalization but lower accuracy, causing combinitive model to have
poor preformance. I basically wrote this in a day so it's really scuff :((
